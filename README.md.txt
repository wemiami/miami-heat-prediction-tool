Miami Heat Player Performance Tool

Overview

The **Miami Heat Player Performance Tool** is designed to predict the performance of Miami Heat players by analyzing their recent game data. The tool uses historical game logs to calculate 10-game rolling averages, last game statistics, and takes into account team-specific performance and rest days to generate personalized predictions for points, assists, and rebounds.

Features

- **Player Selection**: Choose a Miami Heat player from the 2023-2024 roster.
- **Team Selection**: Select the opposing team to factor in team-specific performance.
- **Rest Days Input**: Specify the number of rest days since the player's last game.
- **Predictions**: The tool uses historical data to predict points, assists, and rebounds based on rolling averages and recent performance.

How It Works

1. **Select a Player**: Choose a player from the dropdown list.
2. **Select a Team**: Pick the opposing team.
3. **Input Rest Days**: Enter the number of days since the playerâ€™s last game.
4. **Click "Predict"**: The tool will analyze the data and provide a prediction based on the player's recent form and performance against the selected team.

The tool pulls the data from past game logs and calculates the rolling averages over the last 10 games. It also factors in rest days and past performances against specific teams to generate more accurate predictions.
